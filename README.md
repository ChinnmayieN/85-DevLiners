The challenge is to build the foundational version of EcoFinds, a sustainable second-hand marketplace, as a functional prototype accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The core requirements focus on enabling users to register and log in securely, create and manage their own product listings (including essential details like title, description, category, price, and an image placeholder), and browse available listings with basic search and category filtering features. The system must also allow users to view, edit, and delete their own listings, see details of any product, and manage their user profile. Additionally, users should be able to view their previous purchases and maintain a cart of products they wish to buy. The application should ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, using efficient data structures to manage user and product information, and lay the groundwork for a trusted, community-driven platform that encourages sustainableÂ consumption.
